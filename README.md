**Hey there!** 👋

I'm Saksham Misra, aka vinfinity7. As a student and developer from the colorful tapestry of India, I'm on an endless journey of coding adventures. I dive headfirst into the thrilling world of technology, creating digital magic with Next.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, C++, Three.js, and Git.

## 🌟 What Drives Me?

I'm that guy, always eager to explore and learn. When it comes to programming, I'm like a kid at a drug store, using these tools as my magic wand to craft digital wonders.

## 🌐 Embracing Open Source Fun

I'm here to introduce you to open source organizations that make coding exciting. This isn't about corporate jargon; it's about the joy of coding, teamwork, and a sprinkle of whimsy (not whiskey xD).
